# Usage Guide

Detailed notes beyond the [README](../../README.en.md): task details, in-game settings, auto-correction, humanization, handling of unexpected situations, runtime files and how it works. For command-line usage, see [Command Line](cli.md).

## Requirements

- Windows, MuMu Emulator 12 (this project is tested on MuMu 6.6.x with an Android 15 instance)
- Emulator resolution **1280×720** (other 16:9 resolutions are scaled proportionally but not thoroughly tested; non-16:9 resolutions are rejected at startup), frame rate at least 60 (sync parameters are tuned for 60 fps screenshots)
- Game: International server (package name `com.bilibili.sirius.official`; the Google Play version is `com.bilibili.sirius` and is detected automatically), with the game language set to 简体中文, 繁體中文, English or 한국어; or the Japanese server (package name `com.bushiroad.sirius`). Navigation relies on OCR of on-screen text, so buttons on other servers can't be recognized. For 한국어, set "Game Language" to 한국어: the Korean text recognition model (about 10 MB) is downloaded automatically on the first run and additionally loaded every time after that (both models recognize together, so each recognition is a bit slower); if 한국어 isn't selected, it's neither downloaded nor loaded
- Japanese server: set "Game Language" to "日本語 (Japanese server)", and Start Game and the other tasks operate the Japanese client (no extra recognition model is downloaded). The Japanese client must be installed from Google Play; an APK installed directly won't open. Switch Account only works on the International server. T.G.W CARD and the shop need a one-time age verification done by yourself in the game; until then, Claim Dailies skips T.G.W CARD. On the Japanese server only Free LIVE, AP Completion and Claim Dailies have been verified; Challenge LIVE hasn't been tried there yet
- For in-game settings, see [In-Game Settings](#in-game-settings)
- Access to the chart site `assets.bdon.moe` and the song title API `haneoka.org` (update checks and auto update additionally access `github.com`, which can be turned off). If your browser can open them but downloads keep failing here (the log says "download failed … forcibly closed by the remote host"), enter the HTTP port of your proxy software in the global option "Network Proxy" (e.g. `127.0.0.1:7890`); on the command line set the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable
- Release package: both UIs need the [VC++ 2015–2022 Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) (required by MaaFramework); MFAA additionally needs the .NET 10 Desktop Runtime (the bundled `DependencySetup_依赖库安装_win.bat` installs it and the VC++ runtime in one click), and MXU needs WebView2 (usually preinstalled on Windows 10/11). The package bundles the Python runtime, MaaFramework and the OCR model; charts are downloaded from the chart site at runtime. For the licenses of each component, see [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](../../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md)
- Running from source: Python ≥ 3.11, see [Command Line](cli.md)

## Connecting the Emulator

In the connection settings, choose "MuMu Emulator", then choose the emulator instance to use. The adb address of MuMu 12 instance n is `127.0.0.1:16384+32n`; for example, instance 0 is 16384 and instance 1 is 16416. Screenshots and touches go through MuMu's interface, and the install directory is derived from the adb path, so only MuMu 12 is supported for now.

## Tasks

The game just needs to be on the Home screen or the Free LIVE Select Song screen; it doesn't even need to be running, since every task except Assist Play, Open Stats Window and Test Notification starts it first (or reuses it if it's already open) and then waits through the title screen, login bonuses and News.

| Task | What it does |
|---|---|
| Start Game | Launches the game if it isn't running, taps through the title screen, login bonuses and News, and enters the Home screen. Every task except Assist Play, Open Stats Window and Test Notification does this first, so it doesn't need to be checked separately |
| Switch Account | International server only. Logs out of the current bilibili account, logs in to the specified account from the game's login history (no password needed), then enters the Home screen; if already in the game, restarts the game first to get back to the title screen. Enter the account name as shown in the login history; part of it is fine, but it must match only one account. Can only switch to accounts in the login history; log in to a new account manually in the game once first. To rotate between multiple accounts, order the task list as "Switch Account (A) → other tasks → Switch Account (B) → other tasks". Never taps the account deletion option in Account Center or the ⓧ on the right of each login history row. Play records and Stats & Achievements don't distinguish between accounts yet |
| Repeat Play | Plays continuously in Free LIVE, with a choice of song selection (Current Song / Random / Non-AP Songs First / Song List), difficulty, number of rounds and LB per round. With difficulty set to "Highest Difficulty First", "Non-AP Songs First" fills EXPERT through EASY in order, then picks EXPERT songs at random when all are done; other song selection modes play EXPERT |
| Use Up LB | Plays continuously until LIVE BOOST runs out (checks the count held before each round and stops at 0), without using Stars. Leveling up refills LB, so there may be more rounds than expected |
| AFK Farming | Like Use Up LB, plays until LB runs out, then waits on the Formation screen, following the recovery countdown at the top right until LB recovers to the per-round cost, then continues (LB recovers 1 every 30 minutes; at a cost of 3, that's about one round every 90 minutes). With LB per round set to 0 it doesn't wait for LB: checks the count held before each round, uses 1 if there is LB, otherwise continues at 0, and uses LB again once some recovers, playing nonstop. Runs until stopped manually or the round limit is reached; if the date changes while waiting, it logs in again, and during server maintenance it checks every 10 minutes and resumes AFK farming once the server is back. Option "Scheduled Claim" (on by default, every 4 hours): claims Studio Practice once at the start, then every set number of hours (1–12) returns to the Home screen between rounds or while waiting for LB to claim again, then comes back and continues AFK farming (Studio Practice accumulates for up to 12 hours; beyond that, efficiency drops to 30%); if a claim fails, it tries again 30 minutes later. Option "Claim Dailies Each Day" (on by default, 22:30): each day at the set time (the PC's local time), likewise returns to the Home screen to claim Missions, Mission Pass, Limited-Time Missions, Beginner Missions, T.G.W CARD, the free gacha pull and the Gift Box; if not everything was claimed, tries again 10 minutes later (up to 3 times a day). "Claim Dailies" in the task list only runs once before AFK farming; after crossing into a new day, this option takes care of it. The game's date changes at 23:00 every day, so the claim time must be earlier than 23:00 to get that day's rewards. Doesn't use Stars. It never ends by itself, so put it last in the task list |
| AP Completion | Plays the songs in the selected difficulties (EXPERT / HARD / NORMAL / EASY) that aren't ALL PERFECT yet until they are AP. Temporarily switches the Select Song screen to the "All" category and filters by "NO ALL PERFECT", restoring them after finishing normally. A song that still isn't AP after "Max Attempts per Song" is not played again this run; if none of those attempts finished (sync failure, life reaching 0), the chart is remembered and neither AP Completion nor "Non-AP Songs First" plays it for 3 days (most likely the chart no longer matches after a game update; it is retried later) |
| Challenge LIVE | Only open during some events (ends with an error otherwise). Enters "CHALLENGE LIVE" from the LIVE top page and plays continuously, spending Challenge Pts (CP) instead of LB each round, until CP isn't enough for another round. When the amount held is below the chosen cost the game won't let OK be tapped (it shows "Not enough Challenge Pts."), so the dialog is cancelled and the task stops instead of tapping OK until it times out. The option "Challenge Pts per Round" defaults to 200 (×1, the cheapest, allowing the most rounds); 400 / 800 / 1600 (rewards ×2 / ×4 / ×8) or keeping the in-game setting are also available; before the first round, it selects the cost in the CP settings and verifies the radio button before tapping OK. The song selection "Rotate Through Songs" (default) switches to the next song in the list each round, going back to the first after the last; "Non-AP Songs First" checks song by song before each round whether the selected difficulty is ALL PERFECT and plays non-AP songs first (up to 3 plays per song), then rotates once all are AP (with difficulty set to "Highest Difficulty First", fills EXPERT → HARD → NORMAL → EASY in order); it can also keep playing the currently selected song. Never taps "SKIP" on the Formation screen |
| Assist Play | Only plays the notes; you tap everything else: pick the song and tap LIVE START yourself; it starts syncing as soon as the loading screen appears (taking its baseline during loading, like the other play tasks) and plays automatically once the live begins. The song is recognized on the Formation screen, so go through it (if the song can't be recognized or the chart site doesn't have it, that song is skipped and the log says why); the difficulty is read from the screen, or worked out from the level when it can't be read. Works in Free LIVE, Challenge LIVE and Co-op LIVE (in Co-op the song is recognized on the difficulty-select screen: the difficulty is the large label beside the jacket and the level is the number above that cell; the difficulty is chosen on this very screen, so changing it re-recognizes the song; after you tap Ready it waits up to 40 seconds for the other players and the loading, and skips the round if that takes longer. Co-op cannot be paused and has no pause button, so the play screen is neither confirmed before touching nor watched during play — only the sync result tells whether it is playing the right chart). LIVE CLEAR, result pages and popups are left for you to tap; it only taps ⇄ once on the result page to read FAST/SLOW, and records the result and corrects the offset like the other tasks (if you tap Next before the judgement counts are read, that round isn't recorded; if you tap it after the counts but before FAST/SLOW, only the counts are recorded). If you pause during play and confirm Retry, it plays the song again from the start; after Continue it can't catch up, so that round isn't played. If sync fails, that round isn't played either, and you can pause and retry yourself. Doesn't start or restart the game; runs until stopped manually |
| Claim Dailies | Claims the rewards of Studio Practice (claim), Missions, Pass Missions and the normal PASS tier (one by one when there are several passes), Limited-Time Missions, Beginner Missions, T.G.W CARD, the free gacha pull and the Gift Box in turn; each can be turned off individually. Only taps a lit "Claim All" and OK on reward popups; for T.G.W CARD, it claims the daily points, the daily reward and items priced "Free" in the Shop's Catalog Shop, never those that cost Stars; the free gacha pull (on by default) only runs when the gacha entry on the Home screen shows the free badge, only taps the button labeled free / 1 pull and OK on a confirmation that says 0 Stars, skips the animation with SKIP and then only taps the button back to the gacha top (never "Pull again", paid pulls or ads); the result screenshot is saved in `data/recruit/` and shown in the MXU log, and Stars are checked before and after (only tested with the Simplified Chinese game language so far); it doesn't tap unrecognized popups and stops with an error. Daily missions are only complete after playing songs, so put it after the play tasks. Optional "Read Stories (Skip)" (off by default): skips through unread Band Story, Another Story and Bond Story episodes one by one, unlocking songs and claiming the rewards for finishing them; each episode downloads data the first time (Without Voice; about 30MB for Band Story). Optional "Event Stories (Skip)" (off by default): during a limited-time event, enters the event page via the LIVE top page → "EVENT" (when there are several events and an event selection dialog appears first, taps the ongoing one) and skips through the unread Event Story and Another Story episodes under "Event Story" one by one; this item is skipped when there is no limited-time event |
| Open Stats Window | Opens the Stats & Achievements window (see [Stats & Achievements](#stats--achievements) below; export your records there before switching packages, see [Backup & Restore](#backup--restore)) and lists the play records in the log (charts AP'd per difficulty, charts played but not yet AP, the last 10 rounds). Doesn't operate the emulator |
| Test Notification | Sends a test message with the global option "Push Notifications" (see [Push Notifications](#push-notifications) below). Doesn't operate the emulator |

### Refill LB with Items When Low

Repeat Play, Use Up LB, AFK Farming and AP Completion all have the option "Refill LB with Items When Low" (off by default): before each round, if LB held is less than the per-round cost, it goes through the LB "Settings" → "Recovery" and, only on the "Item" tab, uses Boost Drinks to top up just enough for this round (Small +1 first, then +10 if that's not enough); it taps OK only after verifying that the selected quantity, the recovery preview and the numbers on the confirmation popup all match; if it's not on the "Item" tab or anything doesn't match, it taps Cancel and won't refill again this run. Never uses Stars or watches ads.

The sub-option "Max Refill" is the maximum amount of LB refilled in this run; 0 means until the drinks run out. After the drinks run out, it continues as before (Use Up LB ends there, AFK Farming starts waiting for recovery). Requires LB per round to be set to 1–5 or "Auto".

### LB per Round: 4, 5 and "Auto"

"LB per Round" can be 0–5 (Repeat Play and AP Completion can also keep the in-game setting). 4 and 5 are unlocked at T.G.W CARD Lv.10 and Lv.14; while locked, it uses the largest value the LB "Settings" popup offers and says so in the log.

With "Auto (by LB held)", it opens the LB "Settings" popup before each round and picks by the LB held at that moment:

- Normally the largest cost available (3 while 4 and 5 are locked); if fewer LB are held, it picks the amount held and consumes all that's left.
- "Consume All" (up to 10 LB in one round, usable with 4 or more held; how many times a day depends on your monthly pass, e.g. 5 with the top tier) is used in two cases: 10 or more LB are held, or it saves 2 or more rounds compared with consuming round by round (e.g. with 7 held and a max cost of 3, round by round takes 3 rounds, Consume All takes 1).
- "Consume All" is used until today's uses run out (uses made by hand in the game count too): once the popup shows that today's uses are used up, or it can't be ticked after being used today, that's recorded in `data/state.json` (per account when taking turns with "Switch Account") and it's not checked again that day (game date, which changes at 23:00 every day).
- Use Up LB with Auto ends when LB runs out; AFK Farming with Auto consumes each LB as soon as it recovers instead of waiting for several. AFK Farming with 0 still works as before: consume 1 while LB is held, otherwise 0.

### Use Skip

Use Up LB and AFK Farming have the option "Use Skip" (off by default): before each round it first taps "Skip" on the Formation screen, picks the cost in the confirmation popup according to "LB per Round" (Auto also uses "Consume All" here), and skips the currently selected song; once the day's skips run out it plays normally. Skips don't count as rounds; the log at the end lists how many were skipped.

- It only skips when the round would consume LB (LB per round 1–5 or Auto; AFK Farming with 0 skips only while LB is held, consuming 1). When LB runs out it doesn't skip (if the confirmation popup shows 0 held it taps "Close") and continues as before.
- "Skip" in Challenge Live is never tapped.

### Other Options

- To adjust parameters beyond the defaults (such as the timing offset), copy [config.example.yaml](../../config.example.yaml) to `config.yaml` in the extracted folder and edit it. Options in the UI take precedence over it.
- By default, the UI log only shows progress and results. With the global option "Debug Log" on, sync, chart, touch and other details are shown too; the full log is always written to `data/ournotes.log`.
- The global options "Check for Updates" and "Auto Update" are on by default: when a task starts (and in MFAA also once when the UI opens and connects to the emulator, using the options from the last task run), it checks GitHub for a newly released version and, if there is one, downloads it in the background; progress and results show up in the log when the task finishes.
  - If only the playing part changed, the new version is switched in whenever no task is running, and the next task uses it; AFK Farming with no play limit pauses briefly between songs, switches over, and continues automatically.
  - If something the UI reads changed (tasks, options, UI text), the UI has to restart: once no task is running and the UI has been idle for 2 minutes, it closes the UI, switches over and reopens it (without starting tasks). If the UI is set to start tasks as soon as it opens (MXU's "Also auto-execute on manual launch", or an MFAA startup mode that includes "Startup script"), it doesn't restart the UI for you; the update is applied after you close the UI.
  - If the UI program, Python, dependencies or the text recognition model changed, the whole archive is downloaded and replaced, with the same timing. `config/`, `data/`, `cache/`, `debug/` and the UI's own settings are left alone.
  - The replaced files are backed up in `cache/update/backup/`; if the new version fails to start, the original version is restored automatically, the log says so, and that version isn't auto-updated to again. If restoration also fails, the backup is kept and tasks and automatic updates stop. Follow the log to restore it manually, or extract a release package into a new folder before running again.
  - With "Auto Update" off, you're only told about new versions and need to download the new archive manually. Older versions without the "Auto Update" option need one manual download.

### Stats & Achievements

Total run time, play stats (plays per day, per difficulty, results per chart) and achievements (a few are hidden), updated after every play; run time from before this feature is estimated from the play records. Only counts plays by this tool; the pages are in Chinese only for now. Where to see them:

- The Stats & Achievements window: run the task Open Stats Window, or double-click the 「统计与成就」 (Stats & Achievements) shortcut in the package folder (created automatically after any task has been run from the UI). It refreshes after every play and pops up a notice when an achievement is unlocked. A running task shows what it's doing at the top of the overview (which song is playing, how long until the next LB recovers, and so on), updated every few seconds. If it's already open, it's brought to the front. It opens in Edge's app mode (Chrome if there's no Edge, otherwise the default browser).
- MXU: the Stats & Achievements card at the top of the Settings page; reopen Settings to refresh. The 「在浏览器里打开」 (Open in browser) button at the bottom of the card opens the same page as the window in your default browser (needs MXU's built-in web server, which is on by default).
- MFAA: the description of the task Open Stats Window; click another task and back to refresh. The description ends with a link that opens the window.

When a task finishes, the log shows a line with the run time of this run and the totals; each unlocked achievement gets a "★" line.

### Backup & Restore

Play records, run history, achievements and learned offsets all live in the package's `data` folder, so they're gone when you delete the package or switch to a newly downloaded full package. Before switching, export them with the 「备份与恢复」 (Backup & Restore) button at the top right of the Stats & Achievements window (the page opened by 「在浏览器里打开」 on the MXU Settings card can't export or import; use the window):

- 「导出备份」 (Export backup): choose where to save one `OurNotes-Auto-backup-<time>.zip`. Keep it outside the package folder (for example in Documents) so it survives deleting the old package.
- 「导入」 (Import): open the Stats & Achievements window in the new package and click 「选择备份文件」 (Choose backup file) to pick the exported zip. If you never exported and the old package is still around, expand 「没导出过？从旧的包目录导入」 (Never exported? Import from the old package folder), enter the old package folder (or its `data` folder) and click 「读取」 (Read). It first shows how much will be imported and only imports after you click 「确认导入」 (Confirm import); the page refreshes when it's done.
  - It merges instead of overwriting: records already in this package stay untouched, only missing ones are added, and the same play or run is never added twice; achievements keep the earlier unlock time. Importing the same backup again changes nothing.
  - Learned offsets are imported only if this package hasn't learned any yet. The global offset depends on the computer and emulator, so it's imported only on the computer that exported it; per-chart offsets are imported on other computers too.
  - The files to be changed are first copied to `data/import_backup/<time>` (the last 5 imports are kept), so you can get them back if the result is wrong.
  - You can't import while a play task is running (it writes play records too); stop it first. A task started during an import waits until the import is done.
  - A backup exported by a newer version may need this package to be updated to that version first (you'll be told).
- Gacha screenshots (`data/recruit`) and `config.yaml` aren't in the backup; copy them yourself if needed. If the new package hasn't played anything yet, copying the old package's whole `data` folder over works too.

### Push Notifications

Once you pick a service in the global option "Push Notifications" and fill in "Notification Address", a message is sent to your phone when:

- A play task (Repeat Play, Use Up LB, AFK Farming, AP Completion, Challenge LIVE) finishes: how many rounds were played, how many were FC / AP / failed, and how long it took. Claim Dailies sends one too when it finishes.
- A task ends with an error: what went wrong (the last error in the log) and how long it ran. Assist Play, Start Game and Switch Account notify only on errors (Assist Play runs until you stop it, so it never "finishes"); Open Stats Window never notifies.
- AFK Farming runs into server maintenance: one message when it starts waiting, another when the server is back and AFK Farming continues.

Tasks you stop yourself are not notified. With "What to Notify" set to "Only errors and server maintenance", finished tasks are not notified. The messages are currently in Simplified Chinese only.

| Service | Setup |
|---|---|
| ntfy | Free, no sign-up. Install the ntfy app on your phone (Android, iOS), subscribe to a topic name nobody can guess (letters, digits, - and _), and enter the topic name in "Notification Address". For a self-hosted ntfy server, enter the full URL, such as `https://ntfy.example.com/your-topic` |
| ServerChan (WeChat) | Pushes to WeChat. Log in at [sct.ftqq.com](https://sct.ftqq.com/) by scanning with WeChat, copy the SendKey and enter it in "Notification Address" (a ServerChan³ SendKey works too). The free plan only allows a few messages a day, so you may want to notify only errors and server maintenance |
| Bark (iPhone) | Pushes to iPhone. Install Bark from the App Store, open it, copy the URL it shows (such as `https://api.day.app/your-key/`; one of its example URLs with message text after the key works too) and enter it in "Notification Address", or enter just the key. For a self-hosted Bark server, enter `https://your-server/your-key`. Errors are sent as Time Sensitive notifications, so they get through even when a Focus is on |
| webhook | POSTs the message as JSON to the URL in "Notification Address": `event` (`done` / `error` / `maintenance` / `test`), `title`, `text`, `time` (Unix timestamp), for your own bot or another notification service |

- After setting it up, run the task Test Notification (doesn't operate the emulator) to check that it arrives; if it doesn't, the log says why.
- Treat "Notification Address" like a password: anyone who has it can send you messages, and others can subscribe to an ntfy topic and read your messages. Don't share it; it's never written to the logs.
- If sending fails (no network, wrong address, ServerChan's daily limit reached), the log gets a warning and the task keeps running.
- When running from the command line, set it under `notify` in `config.yaml` (see [config.example.yaml](../../config.example.yaml)) and test it with `ournotes-auto notify-test`.

## In-Game Settings

| Setting | Recommended | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Notes Speed | **5.00** (required) | The sync parameter `play.sync.tau_s = 0.835` was measured at 5.00. Before each round, the speed is read from the Pre-LIVE Option Settings popup and checked; a mismatch only produces a warning in the log and doesn't stop anything: other speeds can still sync, but press timing is shifted overall. Change it back to 5.00, or run `calibrate motion` to re-measure (also see the speed requirement in the [Humanization](#humanization-optional-off-by-default) section) |
| MV / background | Off, or a dark, static background (required) | At the start, it waits for the screen to settle before tracking the first note. With a constantly moving background, it starts tracking after at most 4 seconds, and a bright background can also bleed in, making sync fail or be inaccurate |
| Bar line display (Details → notes settings) | Either on or off | When tracking the first note at the start, bar lines spanning the lanes are recognized and skipped. Version 0.1.3 and earlier mistake a bar line that falls before the first note for the first note, so the whole round is early and life quickly hits zero; turn it off when using those versions |
| Effect and performance levels | Not enforced; turning them down is recommended on a weaker PC | It only looks at the screen for the first few seconds (when there are no hit effects yet), and colored effects are filtered out; after that it plays from the chart and only watches the pause button at the top right. But so far it has only been tested with them turned down: with high effects, bright white opening effects may bleed into the tracking area, or full-screen performances may cover the pause button for more than 2 seconds in a row and be taken as leaving the play screen, stopping touches. Turning them down also makes the emulator frame rate steadier |
| LB "Settings" on the Formation screen | Set automatically from the config key `game.lb_cost` (0–5) or `game.lb_auto` | Before the first round, it opens the popup, selects the value and verifies it; the game remembers it. 0 consumes no LB (LIVE START shows "n ▸ n"). When LB is short, the game consumes all that's left; when "LIVE Boost Recover" (Item/Star/ad) pops up, it only taps Cancel and that round switches to 0 (with `game.lb_refill` on, it first refills with Boost Drinks from Items, see [above](#refill-lb-with-items-when-low)). Leave it empty (null) to keep the in-game setting |

After switching PCs or emulator instances or reinstalling, play one or two songs on a low difficulty first and check the log for sync failures or speed warnings. Screenshot and touch latency differ between PCs, but there's no need to tune anything manually: auto-correction adjusts the timing offset round by round, by at most 1ms per round (see [Timing Offset and Auto-Correction](#timing-offset-and-auto-correction)).

## Timing Offset and Auto-Correction

`play.offset_ms` is the global timing offset; a positive value presses later overall, compensating for latency from screenshots, input and rendering. On MuMu, about -16ms centers the judgments.

After each round, the program reads FAST/SLOW from the result screen. More FAST pushes it later, more SLOW pulls it earlier, and the learned offset is saved to `data/state.json` (added on top of `offset_ms` in the config). In the following cases it only records and doesn't correct: unstable execution (many late batches), or too many GOOD/BAD/MISS (most likely synced to the wrong note).

### Per-Chart Correction

Some charts are consistently FAST or consistently SLOW (among 56 charts played 4+ times, 22 had a large average deviation) and drag the global offset back and forth. With `play.auto_tune.per_chart` on (the default), when a chart's deviation over its last `chart_plays` rounds (default 3) always points the opposite way from the recent global trend and averages at least `chart_threshold` (default 0.4) in magnitude, that deviation is treated as this chart's own: only its own offset is adjusted (at most ±`chart_max_ms`, default ±10ms) and the global offset is left alone for that round. Chart offsets are kept per note speed, so changing the speed means learning them again.

`ournotes-auto records` lists the chart offsets that have been learned (largest first); `ournotes-auto records --clear-chart-offsets` clears them all (the globally learned offset is untouched) — worth doing after a big chart change such as a game update, then let it learn again.

## Humanization (Optional, Off by Default)

Makes results less uniform. In the UI it's among the global options; on the command line, change it with `--set`:

| Config key | UI option | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `play.touch.great_ratio` | Random GREAT (1% / 3% / 5%) | At this ratio of the total number of judgments, picks plain taps with no other notes right before or after and hits them 64–69ms early or late as GREAT (when a round's sync error is large, some of them may become PERFECT or GOOD; GOOD doesn't break the combo). Has no effect when the song mode is `ap` / `ap_first`. When on, auto-correction ignores the FAST/SLOW of GREATs |
| `play.touch.jitter_ms` | Timing Drift (±8 / ±16ms) | Press timing drifts slowly over time (up to ± the set value), plus independent jitter of up to ±3ms per gesture. Capped at 20ms |
| `play.touch.position_jitter` | Random Touch Position | Touch points shift randomly sideways within the note width and move slightly up and down. They never move into the judgment area of an adjacent tap-type note (otherwise the press might be claimed by it), and a held long note never moves into the judgment area of another long note held at the same time. A value of 0–1 sets the amplitude; turning on the UI switch means 1 |

Example: `ournotes-auto --set play.touch.great_ratio=0.03 --set play.touch.jitter_ms=8 --set play.touch.position_jitter=1 run`

With "Random GREAT" on, keep the in-game Notes Speed at the calibrated value (default 5.00). The GREAT window is ±83ms,
and deliberate GREATs land 64–69ms off, leaving only a dozen or so milliseconds of margin for the overall offset: if the speed isn't the one used for calibration,
the offset may exceed that margin, and late GREATs become GOODs (the combo is kept, but the result is wrong).
The faster the speed, the shorter the first-note tracking time (about 1.8 seconds at 5.00, about 0.45 seconds at 10.00), and the harder it is to average out the sync error within a round,
so this margin is tightest at 10.00.

## Unexpected Situations

- If the pause button at the top right isn't visible for `play.guard_lost_s` seconds in a row during play (default 2; paused, popup, hidden by an in-song effect), touches pause and resume once it's back (it was hidden by an effect, so for the rest of that song touches keep going even when it's hidden); if it stays hidden for `play.guard_abort_s` seconds (default 10), the round ends: if the game is paused it restarts from the beginning (counted in `loop.sync_retries`), otherwise (crash etc.) navigation finds its way back. Set `guard_lost_s` to 0 to disable this check
- When first-note sync fails or life drops to 0, it pauses and taps "Retry" to restart the round, without wasting LB
- When the screen stays unrecognized, it checks the game process every 30 seconds; if the game has crashed, it restarts it via adb and logs in again from the title screen. At most 2 consecutive restarts; the count resets after getting back to Home
- Unknown popups with only "OK" (and none of the words Cancel, Confirm, Purchase, Star and the like on them) get OK tapped to continue; the popup text is written to the log and a screenshot is saved to `debug/nav`
- Full-screen performances with "Skip" at the top right (such as character birthday performances) get Skip tapped; for a story that plays right after, it opens the menu at the top right and taps SKIP
- Fallback: if an unrecognized screen doesn't change at all for 60 seconds, or keeps moving but stays unrecognized for 150 seconds (loading and downloading don't count), it restarts the game and logs in again, sharing the restart count above with crashes; it only stops if still stuck after the restarts are used up
- After running for a dozen or so hours straight, the game gets slower and slower (from 60fps down to the 30s), and sync fails or the whole song is off. During continuous play, if the frame rate measured over the last 5 syncs (median) drops below `loop.min_fps` (default 50, 0 = no check), it restarts the game before switching songs; if it's still that low after restarting (the PC itself can't keep up, or the emulator has a frame rate cap), it won't restart for this reason again. After a restart it waits until the game's screen is ready (the display can be found by package name) before continuing, so it doesn't capture the emulator's home screen. Turning off the global option "Restart Game When Laggy" in the UI is the same as setting it to 0
- Server maintenance (the "server is under maintenance" page): AFK Farming taps the return-to-title button every 10 minutes to log in again and check, resuming once the server is back (with Push Notifications on, you get a message when it starts waiting and when the server is back); other tasks fail immediately
- Game updates: the "Download data" prompt at login (additional game data) gets OK tapped automatically to download; the "new version detected" prompt (requiring an app update from the app store) isn't tapped, the task fails immediately, and AFK Farming stops too; update the game yourself and then start again
- Low memory on the PC: when the PC has less than 1 GB of commit left ("Committed" under Task Manager › Performance › Memory), the log warns once; if the play process exits because it can't allocate memory, the UI says the PC is out of memory. Close programs that use a lot of memory or restart the PC, then start again; sort Task Manager's "Details" tab by "Commit size" to see which program is using it

## How It Works (Brief)

1. **Navigation**: screenshot → OCR → determine the current screen from text and positions → tap buttons. Buttons are located precisely by their text first, falling back to fixed coordinates
2. **Song recognition**: OCR reads the song title on the Formation screen, which is fuzzy-matched against the multilingual song titles from the chart site and the International server to get the musicId
3. **Sync**: after tapping start, it waits for the screen to settle, detects the first note appearing above its lane and tracks its leading edge. As the note approaches the judgment line it follows `y - y_h ∝ exp(t/τ)`; after fitting, the arrival time is extrapolated, and the song's zero point is derived from it
4. **Play**: the chart is converted into touch gestures (tap, flick, long, trace), touches are injected via minitouch (MuMu IPC as the fallback), and a high-precision timer sends them on time. Following the game's judgment table, it keeps adjacent notes from "claiming" each other's touch points: neighbors flicking sideways at the same time get staggered start points, and upward flicks / traces that would be claimed by a later tap are pressed early
5. **Results**: reads the judgment counts and FAST/SLOW, records the result and corrects the offset
